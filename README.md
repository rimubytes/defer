# Learning `defer` in Go

In Go, `defer` schedules a function to execute after the surrounding function completes. This is particularly useful for:

- Releasing resources (e.g., closing files, database connections).
- Ensuring actions are completed (e.g., unlocking mutexes).
- Handling errors or cleaning up after panics.
